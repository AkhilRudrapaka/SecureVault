# SecureVault
SecureVault is a secure document storage web app designed for academic cybersecurity labs. Built on a Node.js and MySQL backend with a vanilla JS frontend, it features "military-grade" aesthetics, EmailJS-based 2FA, and bcrypt hashing. The project emphasizes role-based access control and a modern, responsive user interface.
